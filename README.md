# Spam Filter Engine for Websites

## Overview
The Spam Filter Engine is a machine learning-powered solution designed to filter out unwanted emails that are sent by bots or in languages other than the specified language (considered as spam). This engine can be deployed on a server, exposing an endpoint that accepts message bodies in JSON format. The engine then uses a machine learning model to classify the message as either "Ham" (legitimate) or "Spam."

## Features
- Real-time spam email classification.
- Endpoint for API integration.
- Scalable and deployable on a server.
- Easy-to-use JSON input format.

## Prerequisites
Before using the Spam Filter Engine, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:
- Python 3.x
- Scikit-learn (for machine learning)
- Any necessary model files and data

## Project Structure
The project directory structure may include the following files and directories:

spam_filter_engine/
├── mail_data.csv          # Dataset for training
├── model.pkl              # Pre-trained machine learning model
├── mail_spam_checker.py   # Main file ( For Model Training )
├── spma_checker.py        # Run this file for model output
├── tutorial.js            # Tutorial for implementing in Node.js
├── requirements.txt       # List of project dependencies
└── README.md              # Project documentation

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your server or development environment:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spam_filter_engine.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd spam_filter_engine
   ```

3. Run the Main file:
   ```bash
   python3 email_spam_checker.py
   ```
4. Then run the spam_checker.py
   ```bash
   python3 spam_checker.py
   ```
5. In input field give our email context, then it process and show your index numbers ( 0 - Ham / 1 - Spam )
   
## Customization
- You can replace the pre-trained machine learning model (`model.pkl`) with your own trained model.
- Modify the API endpoints or input format to suit your project's specific requirements.
- Add additional features such as logging, monitoring, or user authentication as needed.
